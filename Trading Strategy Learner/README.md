### Manual Strategy vs. Strategy Learner
<img src="https://github.com/PrimalNaimul/Trading-Strategy-Learner/blob/main/Gif/StrategyLearner.gif"/>

In this project, I implemented two trading strategies and compared their performance. The first strategy is a manual strategy, where I developed the trading rules. The other is a strategy learner which developed the trading trading rules using AI. Specifically, it is a classifcation based learner using Random Forests. Both strategies were developed using historical data of JPM and the following technical indicators:

* Simple Moving Average
* Bollinger Band Percentage
* Momentum

* In-sample period – 1/1/08 to 12/31/09
* Out-sample period – 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2011
* Starting value - $100,000
* Commission: $9.95
* Impact: 0.005
* Allowable positions: 1000 shares long, 1000 shares short, or 0 shares
