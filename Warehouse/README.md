## About The Project
In this project, I implement the A* search algorithm to navigate a robot through a warehouse to pick up and deliver boxes to a designated drop zone area. The goal in the first part is find the optimal paths in an effecient manner, meaning the search method accesses as few of the cells as possible. The second part is similar to the first, except the cells  no longer have a uniform cost and there is only one box to deliver.


### Part 1 - Uniform Cell Costs
